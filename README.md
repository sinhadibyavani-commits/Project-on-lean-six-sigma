## Overview
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a method based on a stepwise approach to process improvements.  
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to perform hypothesis testing (Kruskalâ€“Wallis) to analyze process improvement.

---

## Scenario
Imagine you are the Continuous Improvement Manager of a Distribution Center (DC) for a luxury brand.  
The warehouse receives garments that require final assembling and value-added service (VAS) during the inbound process.

### Objective
With the support of the R&D team, you designed training for VAS operators to improve their productivity and reduce quality issues.

### Question
Does the training have a positive impact on the productivity of operators?

### Hypothesis
The training has a positive impact on the productivity of VAS operators.

### Experiment
Randomly select operators and measure the time per batch (time to finish a batch of 30 labels in seconds) to build a sample of 56 records.
